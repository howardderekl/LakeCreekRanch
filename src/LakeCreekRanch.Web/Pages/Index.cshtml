                    <div class="team-content">We fell in love with Montana while visiting friends in Troy over 10 years ago. At that time, we invested in this 102 acre parcel and have been developing it over the years.  We moved to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho  in the summer of 2015 with our youngest of 5 children.  We are originally from Auburn, California.  Our family has enjoyed many wonderful times in Northwest Montana, with its pristine lakes and rivers.  Many happy memories have been made boating on Bull Lake with friends and family.  You can play all day and practically have the whole lake to yourself! </div>
